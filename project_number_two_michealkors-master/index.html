                    Versace has long been recognised as one of the world’s
                    leading fashion luxury houses, and is synonymous with
                    Italian glamour and style,” John Idol, chairman and chief
                    executive officer of Michael Kors, said in a statement on
                    December 31. “We are thrilled that the house of Versace is
                    now part of the Capri Holdings family of luxury brands.

                    If fashion editors have privately expressed surprise; for
                    market-watchers, the transaction was largely expected. After
                    acquiring Jimmy Choo in 2017 for $1.2 billion, John D. Idol,
                    Michael Kors CEO, made it quite clear that another purchase
                    was on the agenda. “Our focus is on international fashion
                    luxury that are industry leaders,” he told press, upon
                    closure of the deal.

                        The Versace family also reinvested an aggregate of €150
                        million of the cash received for their interests in
                        Versace in exchange for 2,395,170 ordinary shares of

                        Creative Officer, the company also said.

                    learned from Carolina Herrera in the year and a half that he
                    worked by her side before his runway debut today.

                        Girls in their teens and twenties can now buy into the
                        label’s school girl-esque miniskirts and flouncy
                        off-the-shoulder florals, while women of a more advanced
                        age still have that Carolina Herrera signature tailoring
                        and floor-length evening dresses. Despite the
                        convergence of these two polar opposite styles, however,
                        the elegance was still all there.
